            After contacting us through the contact form given on our website, our team will send you an official email containing the questionnaire asking for your requirements. As a customer aiming to utilize our services to the maximum, you must compulsorily answer the questionnaire document so that your work will only turn out the way you desire. Any missing information can lead to delays or deviations from your requirements. Additionally, not providing us with relevant details will only result in multiple edits, further delaying your submission. Your requirements will be fully checked by our academic writer to understand whether it is feasible for them. Their response and further details needed from your side, if any, will be shared through an official mail from us before confirming your order.

            Once we’ve agreed on a deadline and work has commenced, it cannot be altered. We are dedicated to delivering your assignment on time, as initially agreed. Our team is strict about not missing submission deadlines. So, we always go for dates earlier than your exact submission date. As a general rule, we will deliver your work at least 2 or 3 days before your submission date to give ourselves enough time to make any unexpected changes.

            Kindly note that the format and guidelines given to us during the initial stages right before order confirmation will remain unchanged. Any alterations suggested after your confirmation will be considered as a new task, potentially incurring additional charges. Several institutions have different versions of formats and guidelines. So, confirm the same before placing an order with us, thereby preventing additional costs.
